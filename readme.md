# Next.js features examples

This is a fork from *rocketseat-content/react-nextjs-typescript-structure*.
Some examples made with next.js, chakra-ui and styled-components, just for testing porpouse.
This app requires and API for products list, to serve and fake api run:

```
npx json-server server.js -d 2000 -w -p 3333
```

Now fake API is running local on port 3333.
After run it, you can now start app for development:

```
yarn dev
```

And for SSG and build tests, run

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

Either, app will run local on port 3000.
